"# ChangeBlindnessAndWorkingMemory" 

ColourTesting.psyexp is the code for an N-Back experiment in Psychopy. 
The experiment has three blocks of 150 trials each.
Block 1 is a 1-back 
Block 2 is a 2-back
Block 3 is a 3-back

In order for it to run, you need to add the path to the condition files:
Block 1 is 'ColourTest1.xlsx'
Block 2 is 'ColourTest2.xlsx'
Block 3 is 'ColourTest3.xlsx'

'Code for n-back test Psychopy' is a copy of the code from Psychopy

Please put changes on the branch called Edits, not the master.
